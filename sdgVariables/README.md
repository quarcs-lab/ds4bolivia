# SDG Variables - Detailed Indicators

## Overview

This directory contains detailed Sustainable Development Goal (SDG) variables for Bolivia's 339 municipalities. Unlike the aggregated SDG indices in [sdg/](../sdg/), this dataset includes the underlying individual indicators that compose each SDG index, providing granular data for in-depth analysis.

## Files

### sdgVariables.csv

Contains 64 detailed SDG variables plus population and urbanization data for all 339 municipalities.

## Usage

This dataset is used for:

- **Detailed SDG Analysis**: Examine specific indicators that drive overall SDG performance
- **Policy Targeting**: Identify specific areas of intervention (e.g., which health indicators need improvement)
- **Comparative Studies**: Compare municipalities on specific metrics rather than aggregated indices
- **Correlation Analysis**: Study relationships between specific variables across SDGs
- **Machine Learning**: Use granular variables as features for predictive models

## Example Code

You can run the examples below in [![Open In Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/assets/colab-badge.svg)](https://colab.research.google.com/notebooks/empty.ipynb)

```python
import pandas as pd
import seaborn as sns
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

# Load detailed SDG variables
url = "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/quarcs-lab/ds4bolivia/master/sdgVariables/sdgVariables.csv"
df_sdg_vars = pd.read_csv(url)

# Examine poverty indicators
poverty_vars = ['sdg1_1_eepr', 'sdg1_1_ubn', 'sdg1_2_mpi', 'sdg1_4_abs']
df_poverty = df_sdg_vars[['asdf_id'] + poverty_vars]

# Calculate correlation between poverty indicators
corr_matrix = df_poverty[poverty_vars].corr()
sns.heatmap(corr_matrix, annot=True, cmap='coolwarm')
plt.title('Correlation between SDG 1 Poverty Indicators')
plt.show()

# Identify municipalities with high malnutrition
high_malnutrition = df_sdg_vars[df_sdg_vars['sdg2_2_cmc'] > 30]
print(f"Municipalities with >30% chronic malnutrition: {len(high_malnutrition)}")

# Compare gender parity across indicators
gender_parity_vars = [col for col in df_sdg_vars.columns if 'sdg5' in col]
df_gender = df_sdg_vars[['asdf_id'] + gender_parity_vars]
```

## Notes

- This dataset provides the granular indicators that compose the SDG indices
- Some variables have missing values for certain municipalities due to data availability
- Years of measurement vary by indicator (2012-2019)
- Units and scales differ across variables - always check the description
