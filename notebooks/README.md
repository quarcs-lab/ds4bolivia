#### esda_dependence.ipynb

**Spatial Distribution & Dependence**

Map classification schemes (BoxPlot, Fisher-Jenks), spatial weights matrices, Global Moran's I, and LISA cluster analysis for detecting spatial autocorrelation patterns.

#### esda_inequality.ipynb

**Spatial Inequality**

Theil index with between/within decomposition by department, Gini coefficient, and Spatial Gini index for measuring how much inequality is spatially structured.

**Run in Google Colab:**

#### esda_heterogeneity.ipynb

**Spatial Heterogeneity (GWR & MGWR)**

Geographically Weighted Regression and Multiscale GWR to detect spatially varying relationships between nighttime lights and regional development.

**Run in Google Colab:**

#### eda_esda.ipynb

**Extended EDA + Spatial Analysis**

A comprehensive notebook combining traditional exploratory data analysis with spatial methods. Includes additional visualizations, statistical summaries, and advanced spatial analysis techniques.

**Run in Google Colab:**

## Prerequisites

To run these notebooks, you need:

```python
# Core libraries
pandas
numpy
matplotlib
seaborn

# Spatial analysis
geopandas
pysal
libpysal
esda
splot

# Machine learning
scikit-learn
```

## Jupytext and MyST Markdown

All notebooks are managed with [Jupytext](https://jupytext.readthedocs.io/) using [MyST Markdown](https://myst-parser.readthedocs.io/) as the source format. Each `.ipynb` file is paired with a `.md` file that serves as the human-readable, version-control-friendly source.

**Editing workflow:**

1. Edit the `.md` file (the source of truth)
2. Sync changes to the `.ipynb` file:

   ```bash
   uv run jupytext --sync notebooks/<notebook>.md
   ```

3. Or sync all notebooks at once:

   ```bash
   uv run jupytext --sync notebooks/*.md
   ```

**Opening `.md` files as notebooks:**

With Jupytext installed, Jupyter can open `.md` files directly as notebooks. You can also convert manually:

```bash
uv run jupytext --to notebook notebooks/<notebook>.md
```

**Note:** Both `.md` and `.ipynb` files are tracked in git. The `.md` files produce cleaner diffs for code review.

## Usage

You can run these notebooks in three ways:

1. **Google Colab** (Recommended): Click the badge above to run in the cloud without installation
2. **Local Jupyter**: Clone the repository and run `uv run jupyter notebook` in this directory
3. **Deepnote/Other Cloud Platforms**: Import the notebook files

**Note:** All notebooks include `!pip install` cells that install required spatial analysis packages. In Google Colab, these install packages not in Colab's default environment. When running locally with UV (`uv run jupyter notebook`), these commands are harmless since all packages are already installed via `pyproject.toml`.

## Learning Path

For best results, follow this sequence:

### For Spatial Analysis

1. Start with [eda.ipynb](eda.ipynb) for exploratory data analysis
2. Continue with [esda_dependence.ipynb](esda_dependence.ipynb) for spatial distribution and autocorrelation
3. Explore [esda_inequality.ipynb](esda_inequality.ipynb) for Theil and Gini inequality measures
4. Advance to [esda_heterogeneity.ipynb](esda_heterogeneity.ipynb) for GWR and MGWR
5. See [esda.ipynb](esda.ipynb) for an alternative ESDA tutorial
6. Review [eda_esda.ipynb](eda_esda.ipynb) for the comprehensive combined notebook

## Data Used

These notebooks use datasets from this repository:

- [regionNames/](../regionNames/) - Administrative names and identifiers
- [sdg/](../sdg/) - SDG composite indices
- [sdgVariables/](../sdgVariables/) - Granular SDG indicators (64 variables)
- [satelliteEmbeddings/](../satelliteEmbeddings/) - 64-dimensional satellite features
- [maps/](../maps/) - Municipal boundaries (GeoJSON)
- [datasets/](../datasets/) - Pre-merged analytical datasets

All data is loaded directly from GitHub URLs, so no local download is required.

## Key Variables

### Poverty Indicators
- `index_sdg1` - Composite SDG 1 Index (No Poverty)
- `sdg1_1_eepr` - **Extreme energy poverty rate** (% of houses, 2016) ⭐
- `sdg1_1_ubn` - Unsatisfied basic needs (%)
- `sdg1_2_mpi` - Multidimensional poverty index

### Energy Indicators
- `index_sdg7` - Composite SDG 7 Index (Affordable Energy)
- `sdg7_1_ec` - Electricity coverage (% of population)
- `sdg7_1_rec` - Residential electricity consumption per capita
- `sdg7_1_cce` - Clean cooking energy (% of households)

### Satellite Features
- `A00` to `A63` - 64-dimensional embeddings from Google Earth Engine
