## Tentative summary

- A number of papers describe a behaviour of increasing (decreasing) regional disparities during periods of economic growth (contraction) in Bolivia. In this paper, we use unsaturated night light data to explore this and other patterns of regional disparities. Studying XYZ municipalities, we find evidence of [convergence during episodes of economic expansion]. When studying municipalities at the rural and urban levels, we [also show that the convergence may be related to faster growth in XYZ]. Municipalities further away from the main cities, with challenging agricultural conditions seem to also grow faster during economic expansions. [We find an association of municipalities posing higher constraints to human capital development with higher regional disparities, and our results appear to be robust to alternative methods for measuring night-lights over the studied municipalities.] (I am participating in a writing workshop for international development scholars, they requested a sample abstract and I thought it may be a good idea to applied to this paper as a way to make progress)
