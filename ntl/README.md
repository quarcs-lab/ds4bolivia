# Night-Time Lights (NTL) Data

## Overview

This directory contains night-time lights (NTL) data for Bolivia's 339 municipalities from 2012 to 2020. Night-time lights are a widely-used proxy for economic activity, electrification, and urbanization.

## Files

### ln_NTLpc.csv

Contains log-transformed night-time lights per capita for 9 years, plus trend-adjusted values.

## What are Night-Time Lights?

Night-time lights (NTL) data is captured by satellite sensors that detect artificial light emissions from Earth's surface at night. This data is valuable because:

- **Economic Proxy**: Strong correlation with GDP, income levels, and economic development
- **Urbanization Indicator**: Tracks urban expansion and electrification
- **High Temporal Resolution**: Annual or more frequent observations
- **Spatial Coverage**: Available for remote areas lacking traditional statistics

## Data Sources

- **VIIRS (Visible Infrared Imaging Radiometer Suite)**: 2012-2020
- **DMSP-OLS**: Historical data (pre-2012)
- Processed through Google Earth Engine or similar platforms

## Data Transformations

### Log Transformation (ln_NTLpc)
- Raw NTL values are right-skewed, so natural logarithm normalization is applied
- Per capita adjustment controls for population size differences
- Formula: `ln_NTLpc = log(NTL_total / population)`

### Trend Component (ln_t400NTLpc)
- Hodrick-Prescott (HP) filter with smoothing parameter λ=400
- Extracts long-term trend from the time series
- Removes short-term fluctuations and cyclical variations
- Useful for analyzing structural economic changes vs. temporary shocks

## Usage

This dataset is used for:

- **Economic Growth Analysis**: Track changes in economic activity over time
- **Convergence Studies**: Compare development trajectories across municipalities
- **GDP Estimation**: Use as predictor or validation for GDP models
- **Electrification Monitoring**: Track expansion of electricity access
- **Spatial Econometrics**: Analyze spatial spillovers in economic development

## Example Code

You can run the examples below in [![Open In Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/assets/colab-badge.svg)](https://colab.research.google.com/notebooks/empty.ipynb)

```python
import pandas as pd
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

# Load NTL data
url = "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/quarcs-lab/ds4bolivia/master/ntl/ln_NTLpc.csv"
df_ntl = pd.read_csv(url)

# Calculate growth rate (2012-2020)
df_ntl['growth_rate'] = ((df_ntl['ln_NTLpc2020'] - df_ntl['ln_NTLpc2012']) / 8) * 100

# Identify high-growth municipalities
high_growth = df_ntl[df_ntl['growth_rate'] > df_ntl['growth_rate'].quantile(0.75)]

# Plot time series for a specific municipality
years = range(2012, 2021)
ntl_cols = [f'ln_NTLpc{year}' for year in years]
municipality_data = df_ntl.loc[0, ntl_cols]

plt.plot(years, municipality_data)
plt.xlabel('Year')
plt.ylabel('Log NTL per capita')
plt.title('Night-Time Lights Trend')
plt.show()
```
