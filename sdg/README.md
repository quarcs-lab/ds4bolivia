## Index Scale

All indices are scaled from 0-100, where:
- **0** = Furthest from achieving the SDG target
- **100** = SDG target fully achieved

## Usage

This dataset is used for:

- **Development Monitoring**: Track municipal progress toward SDG targets
- **Spatial Analysis**: Identify geographic clusters of high/low SDG achievement
- **Policy Targeting**: Identify municipalities requiring intervention
- **Correlation Studies**: Examine relationships between different SDGs
- **Machine Learning**: Use as target variables for predictive models with satellite data

## Example Code

You can run the examples below in [![Open In Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/assets/colab-badge.svg)](https://colab.research.google.com/notebooks/empty.ipynb)

```python
import pandas as pd
import geopandas as gpd

# Load SDG indices
url = "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/quarcs-lab/ds4bolivia/master/sdg/sdg.csv"
df_sdg = pd.read_csv(url)

# Calculate average SDG achievement
sdg_cols = [f'index_sdg{i}' for i in [1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,13,15,16,17]]
df_sdg['avg_sdg'] = df_sdg[sdg_cols].mean(axis=1)

# Identify municipalities with low SDG achievement
low_sdg = df_sdg[df_sdg['avg_sdg'] < 50]
```

## Data Source

SDG indicators are originally constructed by:

**Andersen, L. E., Canelas, S., Gonzales, A., Peñaranda, L. (2020)**
*Atlas municipal de los Objetivos de Desarrollo Sostenible en Bolivia 2020*
